Dropdowns expand to reveal a menu of options. They close themselves when the user clicks out of them.

<ResearchAside>
    Most users will never expand these unless they are super confident the
    option they want may be inside. Are you usre you want to use this pattern?

## Accessibility

If you use this component the following things are already taken care of for you:

<List>
    <HappyListItem>
        Upon activating a dropdown, focus should shift _inside_ the element
    </HappyListItem>
    <HappyListItem>
        Screen readers should be able to tell an active item from an inactive item
    </HappyListItem>
    <HappyListItem>
        Keyboard input and focus should be trapped inside the dropdown
    </HappyListItem>
    <HappyListItem>
        Keyboard users may close the dropdown using the Escape key. 
    </HappyListItem>
</List>

You still need to make sure these other things happen:

-   Upon dismissing a dropdown, focus should return to where it originally was (it is safe to assume 
focus was on the trigger link)
-   Add a hidden "Close" link at the end
