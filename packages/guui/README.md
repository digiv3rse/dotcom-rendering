# Guui

A set of guardian-styled components and helpers

**Alpha package - under construction ðŸš§**

This package is still under heavy construction, please do not install this in applications intended for
use in production. The API may change significantly before it is out of alpha. If you enjoy working on shifting sands and wish to use this package in your application, please talk to the Platform team, or email dotcom.platform.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install @guardian/guui
```

```bash
$ yarn add @guardian/guui
```

## Usage

GUUI components are [REACT](https://www.google.com) components that use [EMOTION](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for writing their associated styles in JavaScript (css-in-js).

### Component library

`guui` contains a library of reusable components that you can import into your own React application.

#### Importing a component

```js
import CloseButton from '@guardian/guui/components/Close';

export default function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <CloseButton
            foregroundcolor={'black'}
            backgroundcolor={'yellow'}
        >
            Click Me!
        </CloseButton>
    );
}
```

### Creating a component

When creating a component with `guui` you must ensure `React` is available in your module. Why? because the JSX a component such as:

```js
<Headline/>
```

Will be transpiled to:

```js
React.createElement(Headline)
```

**How to can you ensure `React` is available?**

**Option 1:** Import your own `React` dependency.

```js
import React from 'react'
```

**Option 2:** Import the version of `React` exported by `guui`.

```js
import { React } from '@guardian/guui';
```

**Option 3:** Automatically load `React` instead of having to import or require it everywhere.

```js
plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        React: 'react'
    })
]
```

#### Stateless component

```js
import { React } from '@guardian/guui';

export default ({ headline }) => (
    <h1>headline</h1>
);
```

#### Stateful component

`guui` also exposes 

```js
import { React, Component } from '@guardian/guui';

export default class Headline extends Component {
    constructor(props: Props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render({ headline }) {
        return (
            <h1>headline</h1>
        );
    }
};
```

### Styling components

You can import [EMOTION](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) from `guui` for writing your css-in-js. 

```js
import { styled } from '@guardian/guui';

const RedHeadline = styled('h1')({
    color: red
});

export default ({ headline }) => (
    <RedHeadline>headline</RedHeadline>
);
```

### Server side rendering guui components

## Contribute

### Publish

From the root directory of the `dotcom-rendering` project, run:

```bash
$ make publish-guui
```

Note: if publishing fails, the guui directory will be left in a strange state. To correct this,
manually run:

```bash
$ make post-publish-guui
```
