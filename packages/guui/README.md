## Install

```bash
$ npm install @guardian/guui
```

```bash
$ yarn add @guardian/guui
```

## Usage

### Creating components

GUUI components are [REACT](https://www.google.com) components that use [EMOTION](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for writing their associated styles in JavaScript (css-in-js).

##### React

When creating a component module you must ensure `React` is available in your module. Why? because the JSX a component such as:

```js
<Headline/>
```

Will be transpiled to:

```js
React.createElement(Headline)
```

How to do this?

Option 1: You can import your own `React` dependency.

```js
import React from 'react'
```

Option 2: You can import the version of `React` used by `guui`.

```js
import { React } from '@guardian/guui';
```

Option 3: Automatically load `React` instead of having to import or require iy everywhere.

```js
plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        React: 'react'
    })
]
```

#### Stateless component

```js
import { React } from '@guardian/guui';

export default ({ headline }) => (
    <h1>headline</h1>
);
```

#### Stateful component

```js
import { React, Component } from '@guardian/guui';

export default class Headline extends Component {
    constructor(props: Props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render({ headline }) {
        return (
            <h1>headline</h1>
        );
    }
};
```

## Contribute

### Publish

From the root directory of the `dotcom-rendering` project, run:

```bash
$ make publish-guui
```

Note: if publishing fails, the guui directory will be left in a strange state. To correct this,
manually run:

```bash
$ make post-publish-guui
```
