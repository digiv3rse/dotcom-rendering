**Alpha package - under construction ðŸš§**

This package is still under heavy construction, please do not install this in applications intended for
use in production. The API may change significantly before it is out of alpha. If you enjoy working on shifting sands and wish to use this package in your application, please talk to the Platform team, or email dotcom.platform.

## Install

$ npm install @guardian/guui
```

```

## Usage

### Publish

From the root directory of the `dotcom-rendering` project, run:

```bash
$ make publish-guui
```

Note: if publishing fails, the guui directory will be left in a strange state. To correct this,
manually run:

```bash
$ make post-publish-guui
```
