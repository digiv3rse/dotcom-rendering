 * This small snippet of javascript is executed at page load. It checks to

 * pattern.
 *
 * If it finds one, it means the reader has clicked a link pointing directly at an
 * image so the lightbox will immediately open. But because we close the lightbox
 * by going back, we need to make sure we have an entry in the history state to
 * go back to, so we create one here.
 *
 * If we didn't do this then you'd end up back where you were when you pasted the
 * url into the browser and unable to access the article under the lightbox.
