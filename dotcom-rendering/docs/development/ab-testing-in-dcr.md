# AB Testing in DCR

## Setting up a client-side A/B test using the [A/B Testing Library](https://github.com/guardian/ab-testing)

The library docs above explain the integration and the API.

### Quick Start

1. [Create a switch in Frontend](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/blob/main/common/app/conf/switches/ABTestSwitches.scala)
2. Ensure that you [create an A/B test](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/tree/main/static/src/javascripts/projects/common/modules/experiments/tests) on _Frontend_.
3. Add your test to [concurrent tests](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/blob/main/static/src/javascripts/projects/common/modules/experiments/ab-tests.js) on _Frontend_.
4. Copy the JS file into DCR (and update to TS types) in [web/experiments/tests](https://github.com/guardian/dotcom-rendering/tree/main/src/web/experiments/tests)
5. Add it to the test array in [src/web/experiments/ab-tests.ts](https://github.com/guardian/dotcom-rendering/blob/main/src/web/experiments/ab-tests.ts)
6. Use the [A/B test API](https://github.com/guardian/ab-testing#the-api)
7. Force the A/B test (ignoring canRun of A/B test and variant) with the URL opt-in http://local...#ab-yourTest=yourVariant
8. Set a GU_mvt_id or GU_mvt_id_local cookie with the MVT ID that matches the test Audience and Audience Offset ([Use this calculator](https://ab-tests.netlify.app/))
9. Check the network tab for the Ophan request _abTestRegister_ has your test and variant

## Gotchas

-   Your ABTest Switch has a sell by date and your abTest has an expiry date. Matching them up avoids confusion.
-   Your ABTest Switch ID is hyphenated and starts with ab- and it must match the JS AB test ID camel cased
-   The aforementioned JS ID _must_ start uppercase. I.E: ab-my-cool-ab-test (serverside test switch ID) === MyCoolAbTest (JS AB test ID)

## Use in Components

```ts
// Within the components
import { useAB } from '@guardian/ab-react';

// Example usage of AB Tests
// Used in the Cypress tests as smoke test of the AB tests framework integration
const ABTestAPI = useAB();

// We can check if a user is in a variant, returns a boolean
// ABTestTest being an ab test that was passed in via the ab test array
const abTestDataAttr =
    (ABTestAPI.isUserInVariant('AbTestTest', 'control') && 'ab-test-control') ||
    (ABTestAPI.isUserInVariant('AbTestTest', 'variant') && 'ab-test-variant') ||
    'ab-test-not-in-test';

// We can get the variant straight from a check for
// whether the test is runnable
const runnableTest = ABTestAPI.runnableTest(abTestTest);
const variantFromRunnable =
    (runnableTest && runnableTest.variantToRun.id) || 'not-runnable';

<div
    data-ab-user-in-variant={abTestDataAttr}
    data-ab-runnable-test={variantFromRunnable}
>
    AB Test
</div>;
```

## Server-side A/B tests

In order to set up a server-side test in DCR, follow steps 1-4 outlined in the `frontend` [documentation](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/blob/main/docs/03-dev-howtos/01-ab-testing.md#write-a-server-side-test).

On the live website, Fastly automatically assigns users to buckets. You can force yourself into a test on your local machine by following these steps:

1) Ensure you are running `frontend` locally and your server-side experiment is enabled in the dashboard.
2) Use the Header Hacker extension to change the HTTP headers as described in the `frontend` documentation. Please note that this is the only way to opt-in locally. If testing in the CODE environment, use the `/opt/in/` link.

You can verify that you have been correctly assigned to the variant by appending `.json?dcr` to the end of an article link (e.g. `http://localhost:9000/world/2021/jan/01/your-article.json?dcr`. This will return the document data in `JSON` format. Your A/B test will be within the `config` object in camel case, as follows:

```json
"abTests": {
	"yourAbTestVariant": "variant"
}
```

You can access server-side `abTests` within DCR wherever the CAPI object is used (`CAPI.config.abTests`).
