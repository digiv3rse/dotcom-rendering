The Dotcom team would like to help you with your proposed change. Please provide us with a brief and concise explanation for what you're looking to do we will try to make the process easier with early feedback or advice.

**When should an RFC be used?**
This is an optional process. If you own the code you're working on or feel confident about the change you're making then you should simply raise a PR as normal. We want developers and teams to feel empowered to make the choice about when to reach out.

However, if your change affects core platform code or is introducing a new concept or pattern, or if you're just looking for more eyes and input then this process is for you.

**Who is responsible for completing this RFC process?**
Once the RFC is raised, it is the responsibility of the _Dotcom team_ (@guardian/dotcom-platform) to provide feedback and help you get your change to the finish line.
