 * the weblayer directly fetching a response from Consent(the identity
 * API).

 * @param emailAddress an unverified email address
 * @param newsletterIdentityName the identityName of a newsletter
 * @returns an object with a status code (500 if the email address
 * has no "." character, otherwise 200) and message string.
